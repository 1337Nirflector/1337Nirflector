Welcome to my GitHub Profile! :wave:

I started learning [Java](https://www.java.com/) in 2016 and developed my first applications. 2017 I began developing plugins for [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) using the [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org/) and [BungeeCord](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/) API combined with different plugin APIs. I develop plugins since 2017 and I founded a [Multigaming-Network](https://starvalcity.de/) with 5 friends of mine where I still develop plugins for. Hopefully we can see each other on the network soon! :wink:

My skills:
- CSS
- HTML
- Java
- Kotlin
- SQL

When I was 10, I started creating own songs with [MAGIX Music Maker](https://www.magix.com/). I practiced a lot, but I felt really limited, so I decided to continue using a more professional DAW and I installed [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/). Fruity Loops is still my favourite DAW and I still enjoy making music. If you want to listen, have a look at my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/valentino-asoleri) and leave a like. :wink: :sound:
